# CASE-STUDY-3-PALMORA-GROUP HR ANALYSIS 
CASE STUDY 3: PALMORA GROUP HR ANALYSIS

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project is carried out to investigate how employee performance ratings and regions affect bonus distribution. 

TOOLS USED:
1. Microsoft Excel
2. Dataset creation
3. Calculations

STEPS TAKEN:
Step 1: Employee Dataset Creation:
I created an employee dataset containing basic information for two employees:

John: Region – North, Gender – Male
Jane: Region – South, Gender – Female

Step 2: Bonus Dataset Creation
A separate dataset was developed to represent performance ratings and their corresponding bonus percentages, ranging from 0% to 20%.

Task 1: Bonus and Total Amount Calculation
The following formulas were used:

Bonus Amount = Salary * Bonus Percentage

Total Amount = Salary + Bonus Amount

Employee Details:
Employee	Region	Salary	Bonus %	Bonus Amount	Total Bonus

John - North	50,000	15%	7,500	57,500
Jane	 - South	60,000	20%	12,000	72,000

Regional Totals:
North Region (John): 57,500
South Region (Jane): 72,000

Company-Wide Totals:
Total Bonus (All Employees) = 57,500 + 72,000 = 129,500
Performance Ratings Summary:

John's rating: 4
Jane's rating: 5

INSIGHTS:
The above results will help Palmora group to identify region with high bonus payouts and investigate the reason.

It will also help analyse the distribution of performance ratings and bonus percentage to ensure fairness.

It will also make the Palmora group consider adjusting bonus rules or performance rating criteria to promote gender equality.
